# Deployment and Payment setup
 - The app was deployed to [HEROKU](https://id.heroku.com/login)
 - The database was deployed to [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/)
 - The app can be reached by the [Link](https://thailand-guiding-light-2fb0b0e33db8.herokuapp.com/)

## Local deployment
1. Clone the repository.
   - git clone`https://github.com/Kay13051976/Thailand-guiding-light-second.git`
  2. Go to the Thailand-guiding-light-second directory.
     - `cd Thailand-guiding-light-second`
 3. Create a virtual environment.
     - `python3 -m venv venv`
     - `venv/bin/activate`
4. install all dependencies.
     - `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
5. Create a env.py file
     - `touch env.py`
6. Add th following lines env.py
     - `import os`
     - `os.environ["SECRET_KEY] = your secret key.`
     - `os.environ["DEBUG"] = "True" or "False" depending on whether you are in development or production.`
     - `os.environ["ALLOW_HOSTS] = your domain name.`
     - `os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = your database url.`
     - `os.environ[CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME] = your cloudinary cloud name.`
     - `os.environ["CLOUDINARY_API_KEY] = your cloudinary api key`
     - `os.environ["CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET] = your cloudinary api secret`
7. Create and migrate the database.
[code image]()
     - `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
     - `python3 manage.py migrate`
     - `After migration, you will need to create a superuser.`
8. Create roles as following:
     - `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
9. Create roles as following:

For example
`Role.objects.create(name='Customer)`
`Role.objects.create(name='Customer)`
`Role.objects.create(name='Customer)`

10. Set the role for the superuser with the role field with id 3.

  `superuser.profile.role_id = 3`    
  `superuser.save()`
11. Go to Profiles and uncomment the default role. Make new migrations and migrate.
     - python manage.py makemigrations
     - python manage.py migrate

After the following steps, you will ensure that the app is working correctly, and any other user registered in your app will only have access as a customer. The rest of the roles will be controlled by the admin
12. Run the server.
     - python3 manage.py runserver
13. Access the website by the link provided in terminal. Add /admin/ at the end of the link to access the admin panel. If you are using Gitpod, you can skip steps 1-3 by clicking this [link](), and start from step4

## The app was initially deployed to Heroku
### Heroku Deployment

1. Create a Heroku account if you don't already have one.
2. Create a new app on Heroku.
     - Go to the [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login)
     - Click on the "New" button.
     - Click on the "Create new app" button.
     - Choose a name for your app.
     - Choose a region.
     - Click on the "Create app" button.
3. In your app go to the "Resources" tab.
     - Add a Heroku Postgres database.
4. In your app, go to the "Setting" tab, press "Reveal Config Vars", and the following config vars if they are not already set:
     - ALLOWED_HOSTS = your heroku domain name.
     - CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME = the cloud name you used when creating your cloudinary account.
     - CLOUDINARY_API_KEY = the api key you got when crated your cloudinary account.
     - CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET = the api secret you got when created your cloudinary account.
     - DATABASE_URL = the url of your heroku postgras database.
     - EMAIL_HOST_USER = the email address you going to use to send emails.
     - DEBUG = True during development, False during production.
     - DISABLE_COLLECTIONSTATIC = 1 during development. Remove this when deploying to production.
     
5. In your app go to the "Deploy" tab.
    - If it's already possible, connect your Heroku account to your GitHub account and then click on the "Deploy" button.
    - If not, you need to copy the Heroku CLI command to connect your Heroku app and your local repository.
      - `heroku git:remote -a <your-heroku-app-name`à¸¸
6. Go to your local repository.
7. Login to your Heroku account in your terminal and connect your local repository to your heroku app.
     - `heroku login -i` - Enter all your Heroku credentials it will ask for.
     - Paste the command you copied from step 5 into your terminal.
8. Create Procfile.
   This project uses Keroku which is require a Procfile that specifies the commands that are executed by the app on startup. You can use a Procfile to declare a variety of process types, including: Your app's web server. Multiple types 
     - `web: gunicorn social_media_project.wsgi`
9. Create requirements.txt This can be done by running the following command.
     - `pip3 freeze > requirement.txt`
10. Add your commit to Heroku.
11. Push your changes to Heroku.
     - `git push heroku master` or 
     - `git push heroku main`
12. Check your app's logs in heroku dashboard and ensure everything is working.
13. After the development is done, you can change the `Debug` config vars to `False` and remove the `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` config var from the config vars on heroku.
To get Cloudinary cloud name, API key, and API secret:
    1. go to the [Cloudinary website](https://cloudinary.com/users)
