## Solved bug
- ![Update doctype in base.html](documentation/update-doctype-base-html.png)
- ![Update doctype in base.html](documentation/update-doctype-login-html.png)
## Unsolved bug
In the last deploy, the static file did not load in the Heroku which I ran out of time to sort this problem.
- ![Unsove bug Heroku](documentation/unsolve-bug-heroku.png)
## Mistake
- I have changed ERD and class in the models.py file many times because it is part of learning and caused me the problem of not being able to migrate the data. I could use the python manage.py shell and the same python I use in your views.py file to update the id value of each row in the database. I can also change them directly by using SQL on my database, wherever it's hosted, but I don't know SQL that well. So, I drop this choice
Or, like permanently, can delete/drop the database and start over. 
According to the limited time I had left before the PP4 submission deadline, I designed to rebuild everything from scratch; it caused me to lose all the git committed history when I tried to look back to see when the bug happened to sort out the Heroku dangerous site I am not able to find it because I assume the bug occurs when I start to apply the bootstrap framework.
- Forgot to adjust the KanBan board in GitHub before start developed the code.
